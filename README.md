My First Algo & Quant Trading Project

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m starting my journey into algorithmic trading and quantitative trading, and this is my very first project. The goal of this project is simple: a buy-and-hold strategy that we implemented to get a feel for trading algorithms and market data.

This project is mainly a learning experience, and Iâ€™ll be building more complex strategies as I progress in my journey.

ðŸ“º You can check out a walkthrough of this project on my YouTube channel here:
